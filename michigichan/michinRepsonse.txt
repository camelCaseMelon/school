I picked this topic because I really like the state of Michigan and I think its nature is beautiful. Therefore, when I was making the website, I was mostly trying to showcase Michigan's natural beauty and get people interested in that.

Creativity- The design, with the bars on each side of the screen, is different from the usual design I would try, especially the vertical text on the left, which is something I have never done before. In addition, the color palette not only represents nature and calm, but is close to the main colors of Michigan's two major colleges.
Time- I spent quite a while on this website- though I was not in class for one workday, I spent over the time of a normal class working on it the last virtual day and over half of this virtual day class's time to finish it.
Professional- I attempted to be professional by adding a navigation bar and making sure my grammar was correct. I made sure everything had clear borders and did not look sloppy, and added a citations page.
Resources- Though I only ended up having one resource, it is definitely high quality and comes straight from the government of Michigan. It can be easily assumed that information from that website is up to date and accurate.

I was not in class at the time of peer reviews and thus do not have any. Is it possible for me to get that done on Friday? Apologies for the inconvenience.

I learned some key things about centering and asymmetry, which led to me making two sidebars.
