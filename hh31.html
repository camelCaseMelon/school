    <h2 class="text">Early Years/Family Life</h2>
    <p class="text">Hoover was born in a small town in Iowa in 1874 to Quaker parents. At age two, he nearly died of an illness. By age ten, both of his parents had died, and he switched homes often along with his siblings. In college, he met his future wife, Lou Henry, and they were soon married, having two sons; Herbert Hoover Jr. and Allen Hoover.</p>

    <h2 class="text">Political Career</h2>
    <p class="text">Hoover was a republican. His presidential career went from 1929-1933, but he served in several influential positions before then as well, such as the secretary of commerce. The Great Depression began during his time, and although he pushed out quite a few policies to try to help, the lack of direct help from the federal government meant that he was regarded as an ineffective president, and this carries on in his legacy. Later on in life, he suffered many health complications, leading to his death at the age of 90.</p>
